        "post": "I was originally going to post a review on Mushishi, but thinking about my thoughts, it didn’t really fit the review format so I’m doing a blog post instead, because Mushishi is one the best shows ever made.So I’ve been watching season 2 of Mushishi Zoku Sho recently cause I had it on hold for years because it wasn’t out yet, if I remember correctly, when I finished the 1st season of Zoku Sho. Mushishi, as most people know is a great show, but goodness I forgot how great it really is. Granted, the show isn’t for everyone, it’s very slow and it has basically the same episodic feel per episode, but this show uses the slowness, the amazing the OST, the animation, and the episodic plots to create a one of a kind show.The one thing I believe would be a good talking point is how other episodic shows, like Cowboy Bebop, use very different types of stories and theme elements per episode, while Mushishi is the same per episode. Not saying there are no differences, cause the stories per episode are different for Mushishi, but the overall vibe is still the same.I feel as though with Mushishi, I want to know this world and get sucked into the calming atmosphere. I do believe Cowboy Bebop is a lot easier to recommend to people and the stories of Cowboy Bebop help to get to know the world it’s in, but I feel like I know the characters better in Cowboy bebop than Mushishi, if that makes sense. The characters in Mushishi aren’t bad, but since we only follow the main lead most of the time, we travel with Ginko to these many locations and see how Mushi effect people, we get to know the world better. Also, yes, I do know I compared a Action Space series to a supernatural Iyashikei series, but it was more in a overall broad view, they are both great and worth watching.All in all. it has been a long time since I’ve seen Cowboy Bebop, and these are just the random thoughts of someone who got back to watching Mushishi.",

        "post": "Ok, this one isn’t really “new” yet it’s still pretty crazy that it’s been nearly 15 years since the end of the older second season of this fan-favorite fantasy story which I’m sure lots of people, including myself, were highly anticipating a continuation of the two’s medieval economic adventures….. and then we waited, and waited, and waited, and waited (and you thought fans of “No Game No Life” had it bad) but then lo’ and behold Toho Animation and studio Passione decide to produce a complete reboot for a newer generation of anime watchers which is also set to be airing a total 25 episodes, compared to the older 12 for season 1 & 2 each as well as an additional one-episode OVA. I’m personally not really sure if this will either be only going over what the past anime told or possibly give us more material that goes past the older S2 but right now it’s just a “wait-and-see” deal. After watching the first four episodes they seem to be going in the same pace as the older anime and doesn’t seem to being rushing the story too much but then again my knowledge of the past anime is pretty muddled. As far as the remake’s looks the overall style more seems to have a much softer visual tone than compared to the sharper visuals of the older, yet I personally think Passione’s animation qualities and overall visual presentation is better-looking than what I remember from the older anime. Speaking of Passione, well, they are somewhat infamously known for doing productions that are more for adults in a sense but will say the new version is still fairly PG-rated and I more think they toned down the nudity in parts compared to the older one from what I remember and of course whenever there are scenes of naked Holo there is always something conveniently covering the naughty bits. The new opening theme is pretty nice to watch and listen to, which is titled “Tabi no Yukue” from the artist Hana Hope, and I think it’s better than the original and highly love the almost oil-painting-like animations of it. The new ending theme is “Andante” from the well-known ani-song duo “ClariS” which is yet again another highly cute medley from the two and and liking the medieval storybook art visuals of it. Also definitely will give props to Mr. Penkin for producing yet another solid anime score for this series and everything heard really fits in with the overall tones and settings. Will this turn out better than the older anime? It’s still too early to tell but I’m fairly positive this will be a pretty good new adaption to this classic tale (can we call stories made from the 2000’s classic? IDK?) that both new and older watchers will greatly enjoy and will give it a “must watch” stamp of approval.",
