# Description
AnimeWidget is a comprehensive platform designed for anime enthusiasts. It provides a rich database of anime series, including detailed information about each series, such as title, genre, and rating. So the rating system is a key feature of AnimeWidget. It allows users to rate animes, and it calculates the average rating and the total number of ratings for each series. The rating system is carefully designed to ensure accuracy and fairness. Only ratings that are not null or zero are counted, ensuring that each rating contributes meaningfully to the overall score of an anime. On Each anime page , you guys can see all the data of the anime, the preview and some pictures of it, you guys can also comment and read other comment from another person. Another feature is forum,this feature allows users to create new discussion threads on a variety of topics, such as specific anime series, genres, characters, theories, and more. Each thread can be viewed by all users, fostering an open and inclusive environment for anime discussions. Finally, Anime Widget is just a website for me to show my skill in MERN stack, it is an amazing experience because first MERN full stack web application that I come up with ideas as soon as I finished learning Nodejs. So I hope you guys welcome it ðŸ«¶ðŸ«¶ðŸ«¶ and I will continue to develop it when i have time and fresh thoughts !!!
